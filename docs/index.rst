Welcome to the PsychCore NGS Variant-Calling Pipeline documentation!

About
=====

The following NGS pipeline was developed by the UCSF Psychiatry 
Bioinformatics Core (PsychCore) team to call variants on large 
cohorts of human sequencing data. The current build is can run 
on either whole genome or whole exome/targeted sequencing data.  
This build can also call variants based on either reference genome 
GRCh37 (hg19) or GRCh38 (hg38). Please note that this pipeline 
is still being developed.
